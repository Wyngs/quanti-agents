All team members were present.

## 2. Discussion Summary  

### Task Division and Review  
- The team agreed to **continue with the previous division of tasks** established by Dotun for Part 4.  
- A key priority identified was ensuring that **Part 3 contains all required features** and is fully functional before we start implmenting **part 4**.  
- Members emphasized verifying each component of Part 3 to ensure nothing is missing or broken.

### Strategy for Part 4  
- The team reflected on the last-minute issues encountered in Part 3 and decided to **work in a connected, synchronized manner** to avoid repeating the same mistakes.  
- A shared strategy was set to ensure incremental progress, faster communication, and early detection of integration problems,, with a special focus on resolving merge conflicts in a focused manner.

### Discussion on Additional Feature  
- Members discussed including an **additional “cool” or meaningful feature** to strengthen the project.  
- **Hetang proposed implementing a group chat feature** specifically for confirmed event attendees.  
- The team discussed the technical complexity and feasibility of this feature.  
- **Dotun suggested adding a color-blind mode**, which was also considered.  
- After evaluating both ideas, the group **finalized Hetang’s group chat feature** as the additional enhancement to include.

### Coordination for TA Meeting  
- The team planned the agenda and presentation points for the upcoming **TA meeting on Thursday**.  
- Consensus was reached on key problems to raise, updates to present, and feedback to request.

### Critical Constraints  
- A strict rule was agreed upon:  
  **No one should modify the Services unless absolutely necessary for a critical implementation.**  
  This is to avoid regressions and maintain system stability during development.
