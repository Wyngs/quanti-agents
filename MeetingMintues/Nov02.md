##  Discussion Summary

**1. Branch hygiene & workflow reminder**

- ## Key points:
  - Adnan accidentally worked on `main`. Team reminded to run `git status` before starting.
- ## Decisions:
  - Treat `main` as protected by convention; create/update feature branches.
- Follow-ups:
  - Responsible: Everyone  
  - Due: Ongoing

**2. Status update: feature branches & applying feedback**

- ## Key points:
  - Hannan finished his branches and will apply Part 2 feedback to UML.
- ## Decisions:
  - Hannan to own integrating feedback into diagrams.
- Follow-ups:
  - Responsible: Hannan  
  - Due: 2025-11-05 (night before Nov 6 deadline)

**3. Standards: UML & method documentation**

- ## Key points:
  - Any structural changes must be reflected in UML.
  - Every method needs a description, parameters, and return values.
- ## Decisions:
  - PRs must include updated UML/method docs when structure changes.
- Follow-ups:
  - Responsible: All contributors  
  - Due: With each PR

**4. AI usage guideline**

- ## Key points:
  - Limit AI to debugging and XML formatting.

  - Avoid using AI to author core logic or documentation text.
- Follow-ups:
  - Responsible: Everyone  
  - Due: Ongoing

**5. Timeline & file structure**

- ## Key points:
  - User stories should be practically done the night before the due date (Thu, Nov 6) to give Hannan & Adnan time to finalize UML.
