## 2. Discussion Summary  

### Things mentioned by Harshit
- Everything in the UML looks good except for missing numbers.
- Bug: Event creator is able to join own event. Considered rigging and should not be allowed. Clients will not always specify complete requirements, so developers have to infer correctly.
- Bug: Registration history had the waitlist entries, but the waiting list did not. Need to correct this and add user IDs to the waitlist in event details.
- Clarified that a barebone front-end is required to test functionality, having the backend and tests is not sufficient.
- The drawing lottery story is essential since verifying a significant amount of functionality depends on it.

- All members shall start working on stories for part 4 and explain progress during next meeting on Monday, November 24th - 5pm
